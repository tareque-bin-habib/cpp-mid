// How does class and object work?

// In object - oriented programming, a class is a blueprint that defines the attributes and behaviors of objects.It serves as a template to create multiple instances called objects.Objects are created from the class by instantiating it, and each object has its own set of attributes and can perform actions defined by the class's methods. Objects can interact with each other by invoking methods and accessing attributes, enabling the modeling of real-world entities and supporting modular and reusable code.

// // How to declare an object

// To declare an object in C++ we can use this ClassName objectName, type of syntext;

// #include <bits/stdc++.h>
// using namespace std;

// class Person
// {
// public:
//     string name;
//     int age;
// };

// int main()
// {

//     return 0;
// }
