// Why do we need -> (arrow sign)
// In C++, the arrow operator(->) is used to access members of an object through a pointer.Using the arrow operator is necessary because pointers are separate entities from the objects they point to.It allows you to dereference the pointer and access the object's members, such as variables or functions. The arrow operator is used when you want to manipulate or retrieve information from an object indirectly through a pointer.Without the arrow operator, you would need to use the dot operator(.) which is only applicable when working directly with objects, not pointers.
